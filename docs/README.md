# GoSupplyChallenge

The goal of this challenge is to develop a web api with basic security that has the following sql queries for:

    1. Insert students  
    2. Return the students of a province.  
    3. Group (LINQ) to get the number of students per teacher.

On Database (A complete procedure, with parameters, body, etc... will work)
    1. Obtain the different provinces to which the students belong and the number of students in each province (SQL). 
    2. Obtain the province that has more students in the course (course must be a parameter of the procedure) and then 
    how this procedure would be executed in sqlserver.
